# Converting Photoshop paths to SVG

Grab the file here:

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/photoshop-paths-to-SVG/master/pathtosvg%2Cjsx" download>pathtosvg.jsx</a>

This is a photoshop "jsx" script that turns all paths in the active document
into a single SVG file for use in something else. Simply download the script
to "somewhere", then run it through *file* → *scripts* → *browse*, find the
script and open it.

This will immediately run the conversion and put the result in your clipboard:

Saving this and opening this in something like Inkscape gives us:
